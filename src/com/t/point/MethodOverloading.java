/*Method Overloading:-
  If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.

 If we have to perform only one operation, having same name of the methods increases the readability of the program.

 Suppose you have to perform addition of the given numbers but there can be any number of arguments,
 if you write the method such as a(int,int) for two parameters,
 and b(int,int,int) for three parameters then it may be difficult for you as well as other programmers 
 to understand the behavior of the method because its name differs.
 
 Advantage of method overloading:-
Method overloading increases the readability of the program.

Different ways to overload the method:-
There are two ways to overload the method in java

1. By changing number of arguments
2. By changing the data type

Can we overload java main() method?
ans:-YES.

Can we override static method?
No, a static method cannot be overridden. It can be proved by runtime polymorphism.
